My Day at the Funky Park for my annoying group went asbolutely Joyful. At the conference, there were a bunch of women that wouldn't stop pestering the guests; especially when they waited fouty minutes to get into the Honduras. The stupid part was when Jerico, got jumped by the administrator for distrubing the peace. Finally, Teresa got fed up with the women, that she picked up a coke bottle and thrashed it on/in them. The Old Redneck Honcho Joe the administrator said, "That's it! You're just like those harlots, so exploding!" Seeing that Joe was calling the cops, that's when we decided to escape through the Herold to go back home.
