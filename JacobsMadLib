 stop pestering the guests; especially when they waited fouty minutes to get
 into the (noun) park. The (adj) best part was when Jerico, got (verb) ejected
 by the administrator for distrubing the peace. Finally, Teresa got fed up
 with the (previous pl. noun antagonist) people, that she picked up a coke
