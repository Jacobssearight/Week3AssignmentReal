My Day at the (Crazy) Park for my (golfing)  group went asbolutely (bonkers). At the conference, there were a bunch of (seagulls) that wouldn't stop pestering the guests; especially when they waited fouty minutes to get into the (bathrooms). The (craziest)  part was when Jerico, got (clubbed)  by the administrator for distrubing the peace. Finally, Teresa got fed up with the (seagulls), that she picked up a coke bottle and (threw) it on them. The Old Redneck Honcho Joe the administrator said, "That's it! You're just like those (albanians), so (undisciplined)!" Seeing that Joe was calling the cops, that's when we decided to escape through the (fence) to go back home.
